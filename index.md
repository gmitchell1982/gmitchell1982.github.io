# Portfolio Landing Page
I am currently actively seeking employment in data, research, or design/development.

## Self Introduction
Hello and welcome to my portfolio space, people call me Jerry.

My formal educational background is in social and personality psychology with emphasis on research methodology and statistical analysis. Within this field I focused most of my attention on modeling the role of individual differences in predicting outcomes in decision theory, motivation, attitude change, affect, and related subfields.

I have been involved in hobby programming, with occassional forays into freelance and contract work, since 1993. Yes, I have been working for money and barter since childhood.

### My Usual Workflow Process
When left to my own devices and not being managed directly by others, I have a tendency to fall into a fairly strict pattern of project work behavior. The following is my attempt to simplify and explain this so others can understand my natural tendencies.
1) Locate Potential for Investigation
2) Design Study(s)
3) Propose Study(s)
4) Gather Data
5) Clean Data
6) Analyze Data
7) Visualize Data
8) Report Findings
9) Suggest Potential For Further Investigation(s)
* Note: loops of draft/process improvement can exist within his generalized sequence

### My Biggest Project Interests
The following is a list of my favorite kinds of projects to work on, **NOT** a comprehensive list of things I will work on.
1) Human Behavior & Decision Making (including surveys and attitude change)
2) Individual Difference Research (identifying and modeling how individual data points differ from each other and from the generalized 'toy' model, such as mediating and moderating effects and complex interactions)
3) Writing programs that provide inceased efficiency to the end user (with or without automation)
4) Meta-Programming, Pipeline Design, and making one software control another software

## Portfolio Projects
Unfortunately, I am relatively new to both git and GitHub. Many of my old projects were done in languages that are now dead or were lost with the end of the 3.5" floppy disk era. Many of my more recent projects have been for clients where I no longer own the code or involve highly specific proprietary business processes that clients do not wish to be made public. Some of my past clients are willing to allow me to post projects publicly if I redo the projects to remove reference to proprietary processes and/or sensitive information. If I have to redo these projects anyway, it will probably easier and more efficient to also translate the projects into languages that are actually in demand.

As I finish old project revists, new actual projects, and skill display exercises, they will appear here.
